The post and get requests are variables that are used to collect
data from forms that are written in HTML.

$_GET Variable:

The $_GET syntax is ($_GET['name of the form field goes here']).
An example of the usage of the $_GET Variable is given below:

($_GET['name'])

In the above example, the $_GET variable will be collecting the value
that is assigned to it from the HTML form, which in this case is
'name'. 

The data that is being collected by it will then be displayed 
in the URL of the HTML form. For example, if data is being taken from 
a form with the URL (www.zoeyhouse.com), the data will be displayed
after the URL like so:

(www.zoeyhouse.com?name=arif)

The data being collected by the $_GET variable in this example will be
'name = arif'. This data is also known as a query string.



$_POST Variable:

The $_POST variable is only slightly different from the $_GET variable
in the way that the $_GET variable will display the data being 
collected in the url and $_POST does not.

The data that is being collected by the $_POST variable is invisible
to others and the amount that can be sent is not limited besides 
the 8MB max size.

Furthermore, Before you can use the $_POST variable, the HTML form 
must possess the method equal to the $_POST variable. 
After that, you can use the $_POST variable in your php script 
to get the data that you wanted.

The $_POST syntax is similar to the $_GET syntax:

($_POST['name of the form field goes here']).
