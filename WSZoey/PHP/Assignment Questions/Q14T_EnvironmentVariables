PHP environment variables are variables that allow your scripts to 
dynamically obtain certain types of data from servers.

This allows for script flexibility in a potentially changing server 
environment.

You can access these variables using the $_SERVER and $_ENV arrays.

For example, by using the SITE_HTMLROOT variable, you can create 
a variable in your PHP script that will automatically provide the 
correct path to your document root on any Grid server, 
without necessitating any changes in your script. 

Here is an example of how the variable is used:

Filename: environment.php

<?php

$site_path_var = $_SERVER["SITE_HTMLROOT"];
