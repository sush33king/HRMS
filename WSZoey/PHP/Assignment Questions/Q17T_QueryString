A query string is a set of characters input to a computer or 
Web browser and sent to a query program to recover specific 
information from a database.

Referring back to Question 15 about the $_POST and $_GET variables,
it was mentioned that the $_GET variable displays the data it is
collecting after the URL of the HTML form it is collecting form like
so:

(www.pageurl.com?value=10)

The data being collected, which in this case is '?value=10' is known
as a query string as is being passed onto a query program in a
different location to be processed.
