Code execution can be grouped into categories as shown below:

Sequential – this one involves executing all the codes in the order in 
which they have been written.

Decision – this one involves making a choice given a number of options. 
The code executed depends on the value of the condition.

A control structure is a block of code that decides the execution path 
of a program depending on the value of the set condition.

Here are some examples of the control structures that exist in php:


PHP IF Else:

If… then... else is the simplest control structure. It evaluates 
the conditions using Boolean logic and should only be used if:

A) You have a block of code that should be executed only if a 
certain condition is true.

B) You have two options, and you have to select one.

C) If… then… else if… is used when you have to select 
more than two options and you have to select one or more.

Below is the syntax for the If...Elseif...Else control structure.

If (Condition1)
{
    (Block of code to execute)
}

Elseif (Condition2)
{
    (Block of code to execute)
}

Else
{
    (Block of code to execute)
}


PHP Switch Case:

Switch… case is similar to the if then… else control structure.
It only executes a single block of code depending on the value of the
condition.

If no condition has been met then the default block of code is 
executed.

It has the following basic syntax:


switch(condition){

case value:

//block of code to be executed

break;

case value2:

//block of code to be executed

break;

default:

//default block code

break;

}
